Our story today is called “One Thousand Dollars.”
It was written by O. Henry. Here is Steve Ember with the story.

"One thousand dollars," said the lawyer Tolman, in a severe and serious voice.
"And here is the money.”

Young Gillian touched the thin package of $50 bills and laughed.

"It's such an unusual amount," he explained kindly to the lawyer.
“If it had been $10,000, a man might celebrate with a lot of fireworks.
Even $50 would have been less trouble."

"You heard the reading of your uncle's will after he died," continued the lawyer Tolman.
"I do not know if you paid much attention to its details.
I must remind you of one.
You are required to provide us with a report of how you used
this $1,000 as soon as you have spent it.
I trust that you will obey the wishes of your late uncle."
